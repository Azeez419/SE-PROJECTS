# Project Overview

CampusRide is a web application that helps university students share taxi rides in a safe, affordable, and eco-friendly way.

Students can:

Offer rides

Request rides

Plan trips together

Communicate within the app

All users are verified students, helping to build trust and improve safety within the community.



# Why CampusRide?

Travel costs can be expensive for students, especially for taxis. CampusRide helps students:

Split travel costs

Reduce the number of cars on the road

Travel more safely with other students

Support a community-based transport system

The app focuses on coordination, not real-time taxi dispatching.



# Virtual Ride Credit System

CampusRide does not use real money.

Instead, it uses virtual ride credits that only work inside the app and have no real-world value.

This approach:

Avoids security risks

Protects user privacy

Removes legal and payment issues

Still demonstrates how transactions and rewards work



#  How the Credit System Works

Students earn credits by offering rides

Example: Give 1 ride → Earn 1 credit

Students spend credits when requesting rides

Example: Request 1 ride → Spend 1 credit

Each student can view their credit balance on their profile and dashboard

This system encourages participation while keeping the platform simple and safe.



#  Key Goals of the Project

Improve student travel coordination

Promote cost sharing and sustainability

Build trust through verified users and ratings

Demonstrate a realistic ride-sharing system without real payments
